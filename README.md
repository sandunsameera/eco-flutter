# Eco-Gamblin

## Why
We heard some awesome news during the peak of the pandemic, as an example, Earth is healing as world carbon pollution falls 17% during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic. Another example is, the ozone layer is healing during the lockdown. But this is not going to last for long. That's why we came up with an application called Eco-Gambling. Eco gambling is an application that is going to host community challenges that answer for the environmental challenges the earth is facing.

## What Eco-Gambling does
Users can access the application either by logging via google or Facebook. Let's start with the profile screen.
So in the profile section, the user initially gets a dark Earth. So the main goal of the user is to heal the world by using the points he gains from gambling with others or completing the challenges. In this screen, it shows what is the progress of users' world and his overall performance and his past pictures and videos posted for challenges. Let's move to the challenges of the month screen. In this section, we are providing a challenge to the users every week to help to solve environmental problem earth is facing. User can get any challenge which he needs to complete in order to win the points to heal their earth in order to make progress in the app. It can be a beach cleaning challenge or tree planting challenge or any challenge which will contribute to making the earth a better place. By selecting a challenge user will navigate to a screen where users can see what they have to do to complete the challenge. By accepting the challenge the user will be navigated to a screen where the user would see other participants have done to complete the challenge. So users can also submit their post as a completion of the challenge in order to win the points. But more importantly, users can compete with each other to earn more points by winning the competition and make their earth a better one really quickly. Users can earn by voting as well and also they can share the posts in any social media as well. There is a leaderboard as well to show who is leading this competition of healing the world.
